# Reverse-TCP-Connection-Stimulation
 Metasploit and msfvenom is used to create a malicious payload (reverse_shell.exe) for covert remote access. The payload was hosted on a local HTTP server and executed on a target Windows machine, establishing a reverse TCP connection back to the attacker's system. Using Metasploit's handler, remote command execution was achieved.
